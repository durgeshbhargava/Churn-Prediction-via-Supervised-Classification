# Customer Churn Prediction Using Supervised Classification

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting customer churn for an e-commerce platform using supervised classification models. By analyzing account-level data, the goal was to identify high-risk customers, uncover churn drivers, and design cost-effective, segment-specific retention strategies to improve customer loyalty and long-term revenue growth.

## 🎯 Objectives

Build a supervised classification model to predict churn.

Perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA).

Identify the most important churn drivers.

Propose business strategies for churn reduction and retention.

## 🛠️ Skills & Tools Covered

Machine Learning: KNN, Random Forest, Logistic Regression

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Univariate, Bivariate, Multivariate analysis

Data Processing: Data cleaning, feature engineering

`Evaluation: Accuracy, precision, recall, balanced accuracy

## 📊 Approach

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing – handled missing values, standardized formats, and encoded categorical variables.

Exploratory Data Analysis – studied tenure, payment types, and user count as potential churn drivers.

Modeling – implemented KNN, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression.

Evaluation – KNN outperformed other models on both training and test datasets.

Insights & Strategy – identified short tenure, payment mode, and user count as key churn drivers.

## 🔑 Key Findings

KNN Model achieved the best balance between accuracy and generalization.

Churn Drivers: short tenure, payment type, and user count.

Retention Strategies: referral programs, loyalty rewards, bundled family plans, and personalized offers.
